## Challenges faced when setting up my project.
1. I had a changelle setting up Tailwind version 4.
Tailwind Config Misalignment
Tailwind v4 uses ESM syntax. Your tailwind.config.js might need to become tailwind.config.mjs, and you'll use:

## // tailwind.config.mjs
export default {
  content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
